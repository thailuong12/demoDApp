# Simple Demo of Ethereum decentralized application

This is a contract example code for a real estate dApp. It may contain a lot of bugs so please don't use it in real life.

## Setup

Install Truffle framework:

```bash
npm install -g truffle 
```

For Test Net, you can use Ganache, you can download it at: https://truffleframework.com/ganache

## Compile the Contract

Clone the code from this repository and change the directory to the contracts folder, then run:

```bash
truffle compile

Compiling .\contracts\Migrations.sol...
Compiling .\contracts\RealEstate.sol...
Writing artifacts to .\build\contracts
```

The contracts will be compiled and the ABIs will be imported into a new  build/contracts folder

## Migrate the Contract

Remember to start the Test Net first by launching Ganache or using other Test Net.

You can also configure the setting for contract migration in the truffle.js file:

```json
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*"
    }
  }
};
```

Run the following command to migrate the contract into the network:
```bash
truffle migrate

Using network 'development'.
